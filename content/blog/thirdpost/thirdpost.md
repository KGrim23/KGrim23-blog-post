We learnt about bootstrap framework and advantages of it.

-Bootstraps Course work:

1. **Pick a topic/subject close to your heart, or a business local to you.**
2. **We're going to design a website based on that topic.**
3. **Take a look around rival businesses or similar sites based on your topic. Can you replicate what they are doing using HTML and Bootstrap CSS?**
4. **Feel free to add your own CSS, but the main bulk of the work should be done using Bootstrap**


- Carousel Hero section
- Accordion for info
- Cards for skills section
- Use a contact form - weâ€™ll show you how to get submissions from it later in the course!
